<div class='about'>
The goal of this project is to provide an interactive map of public artwork in Atlanta.
<br>
Hopefully you'll discover nearby art that you didn't even know about.
<br><br>
Follow us on twitter if you would like to be notified of new additions to the map, and feel free to send requests or ask questions via twitter as well.
<br><br>
If it's not immediately obvious, we have no web design experience. If you want to offer advice, criticism, or anonymous insults and rage, tweet it.
